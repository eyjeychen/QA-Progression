**Solving Equivalence Partitions**

- Understand to use only one value from each partition unless you have to
- If there is an answer option that users more than one value from the same partition it is most likely to be a wrong answer

**Boundary Value Analysis**

- Error tends to cluster around boundaries
- Works hand in hand with EP
- BV is the min max values of a partition
- Example:
- Given a range of 20 to 50
    - 2 value BVA = 19, 20, 50, 51
    - 3 value BVA = 19, 20, 21, 49, 50, 51

**Note:** in this day I focused on the questions for EP and for BVA, for august 2 that will be the same process

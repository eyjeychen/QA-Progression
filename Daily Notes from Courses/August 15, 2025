**Exploratory Testing**

- Use the tester’s experience to test the software w/o going into the formal cycle of writing test conditions, test cases and test procedures
- Keyword is “simultaneously” create all of these (writing test conditions, test cases and test procedures)
- More effective if the tester has experience
- Conducted using “session-based testing” to structure the activity or meaning fixed duration
- Uses a **test charter** which contains test objectives which focuses on critical areas
- **Test charter can be produced as part of the test analysis**
- Use **test session sheets**  to document the steps followed and the discoveries made
- Is most useful when there are few or inadequate specifications or significant pressure on time

**Checklist-based Testing**

- Like a to-do list
- In this testing, a tester designs, implements, and executes tests to cover test conditions from a checklist
- Checklists can be generic or specialized
- Should not contain items that are checked automatically, items better suited as entry/exit criteria, items that are too general
- If checklists are high-level, some variability in the actual testing is likely to occur so it leads to better coverage

Test Planning
Test strategy or test policy provides a generalized description of the test process, usually at the product or organizational level
The test strategy Describes at a high level the "how" of testing for an organization
The test approach is the implementation of the test strategy
"How we will test this project"
A test plan is how we will implement this test approach for this project
Purpose and Content of a Test Plan
A project plan for the testing work to be done in development or maintenance project
A test plan is used as a vehicle for communication with other members of the project team
Ensures there is a list of tasks and milestones
What to do, whenm how, by whom, etc
Purposes include:
Identifying objectives
Documents the needed resources
Documents processes
Documents the means or how to satisfy the test objectives and test schedule
Decide test results will be evaluated
Means of communications with team members
Guides the tester's thinking
Test Plan Elements:
Context of Testing:
Defining the test objectives
Testing scope
Test basis
Assumptions and constraints of the test project:
Assumptions
Constraints
Stakeholders
Communication
Risk Register
Budget and Schedule
Test Approach
This is where to explain how we will perform the testing by defining the test levels test types test techniques test deliverable, entry and exit criteria
Agile Planning vs. Traditional Planning
Agile projects have high degrees of uncertainty and risks
Therefore in agile projects, creating detailed upfront plans is problematic because the requirements in agile projects are progressively elaborated
Therefore, the planning in agile is performed in short intervals throughout the lifecycle
Difference between agile and traditional planning is that agile planning is done at a high level in the beginning of the project
Agile Planning Stages
First level: product vision
Second-level: Product planning
Release Planning and Iteration planning
Release Planning
Iteration: short development period
Release: Group of iterations
Looks ahead to the release of a product
A release often takes a few months, say 3-9 months
Release plans are high level
Factors that May trigger release plans:
Delivery capabilities
Technical Issues
The discovery of new markets and opportunities
New competitors
Business threats
Tester's Contribution to Iteration and Release Planning
Release planning: release of a product, serves as a basis for the test approach and test planning
Testers involved in Release Planning:
Participate in writing testable user stories and acceptance criteria
Participate in project and quality risk analyses
Estimate test effort associated with user stories
Determine the test approach
Planning the testing for the release
Testers involved in Iteration Planning:
Participate in the Detailed Risk Analysis of User Stories
Determine the Testability of User Stories
Break Down User Stories into Tasks
Estimate Test Effort for All Testing Tasks
Identify and Refine functional and non-functional aspects of the test object

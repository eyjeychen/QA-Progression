White box test techniques
Also called structure-based testing
Since you have information on the structure of the test object
Info such as how the database and system is built, modules are organized and access to the source code itself
Example: 
Age is used in a byte so you'll use values outside of a byte

Characteristics of white box techniques
TCS are derived from a test basis that may include anything related to the structure of the software 
Concept of coverage is heavily used. Measured based on the items within a selected structure
Specifications are often used as an additional source of information to determine expected outcome of test cases
Can be used at all test levels
White box testing techniques are used to assess the amount of testing performed by tests 
Statement Testing and Coverage
Statement testing exercises the executable statements in the code
Statement coverage is determined by the number of executable statements covered by the executed test cases/ Total number of statements
Statement coverage is the weakest white-box techniques
In statement coverage, size of the test cases do not matter
Statement coverage can't tell us anything about how many statement in the code cant be executed
100% coverage means every executable statement was executed at least once

Branch Testing and Coverage
Does not look at the code from the statement’s point of view
Used to test every possible branch in the control flow graph of a program
Every branch in the code is executed at least once
Example: an IF statement has 2 branches (one branch for TRUE, one branch for FALSE outcome
For a SWITCH statement, there is a branch for all the possible case
To get the total number of branches = multiply total number of IF statements by 2 (2 IF Statements = 4 branches)
Statement testing may provide less coverage than branch testing
Branch coverage helps to find defects in code where other tests have not taken both true and false outcomes
100% branch coverage guarantees 100% statement coverage but not vice versa
The Value of White-box testing
Is able to detect some of the intended features by understanding the logic used to implement such features
Can be used in static testing 
Can be used in dry runs of the code 
Well suited to review code that is not yet ready for execution 
Can be used as a coverage measurement technique
Adding more test cases to increase coverage
Experience-based Test Techniques
Error guessing
Exploratory Testing
Checklist-based
Are derived from the user’s and tester’s skil land intuition 
Helps to identify tests that were not easily identified by other systematic techniques
May not be measurable by coverage
Derived from a test basis that include tester’s and user’s experience
Error Guessing
Used to anticipate the occurrence of errors ,defects and failures based on the tester’s knowledge
Items such as how has the application worked in the past? What types of mistakes do the developers tend to make?
Not intended to be used by itself but rather support other test techniques
Effectiveness of the error guessing technique varies heavily on the tester’s experience
Fault attack = enumerate possible list of faults and defects

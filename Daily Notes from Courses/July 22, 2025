**Static Testing Basics**

- Is testing without executing code
- First line of defense against defects
- Relies on examining the software products
- Involves manual reviews and static analysis
- Static Analysis
    - Essential for safety-critical computer systems
    - Part of security testing
    - Incorporated into automated tests
    - Helps to identify problems prior to dynamic testing
- Static Analysis Test Objectives
    - Enhancing quality
    - Finding Bugs
    - Evaluating features
- Involves review techniques
    - Ensures user stories are complete and understandable

**Differences between static and dynamic testing**

- Static:
    - Finds defects
    - Improve consistency, and internal quality
    - Can be applied to non-executable work products
- Dynamic:
    - Finds failures
    - Focuses on externally visible behaviors
    - Can only be applied to executable code
- Typical Defects found in static testing:
1. Requirements Defects
2. Design Defects
3. Coding Defects
4. Deviations from standard
5. Incorrect interface specification
6. Security vulnerabilities
7. Gaps and inaccuracies in test basis

Will put notes here from the study from the cafe
**July 26, 2025**

**Work Products that Can Be Examined by Static Testing**

- Any written work products that a human can withstand
- Specifications
- Epics, user stories and acceptance criteria
- Architecture and design specifications
- Source Code
- Testware
- User guides
- Web Pages
- Contracts, projects plans, schedules, budget
- Models, such as activity diagram

**Benefits of Static Testing**

- Early detection of defects
- Identification of defects
- Preventing Defects
- Increasing development productivity
- Reduced development timescales due to lesser bugs
- Reduced testing time and cost
- Reducing total cost of quality
- Improving communication between members in reviews
- Evaluate quality and build confidence in work products

**Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback**

- Prevent misunderstanding about requirements
- Ensure changes to requirements are understood and implemented earlier
- Helps development teams to improve understanding
- Allows teams to focus prioritizing these features

**Work Product Review Process**

- Informal reviews do not follow a defined process
- Formal reviews follow procedures
- ISO ECE 20246 is a review process
- Five Groups of Activities in the Review Process
1. Planning
- Defining the scope
- Estimating effort and timeframe
- Identifying review characteristics
- Selecting people who will participate in the review
- Define entry and exit criteria
1. Review Initiation
- All reviewers should know what they are reviewing
- Distributing the work produced
- Explaining the scope
- Answering questions
1. Individual Review
- Each of the participants will review alone
- Noting potential defects
1. Communication and Analysis
- Communicate identified potential defects
- Evaluate quality characteristics
- Evaluate review findings
1. Fixing and Reporting
- Defect reports

**Roles and Responsibilities in Reviews**

1. Author
- Creates work product for review
- Fix defects in the created work product
1. Manager
- Review Planning
- Execution of reviews
- Assign staff, budget and project schedules
- Control decisions made
1. Moderator or Facilitator
- Effective planning and review meetings
- Ensures no bug fixing will be discussed in the review meeting
- Mediates
1. Review Leader
- Overall responsibility for the review
- Decides who will be involved and organizes the when and where
1. Reviewers
- Subject matter experts
- People in the projects
- Potential defects on the work products
1. Scribe/Recorder
- Collects potential defects found in the review meeting

**Review Types**

- Focus of any review depends on the agreed objectives of the review
- Review types depend on:
1. SDLC Model
2. More mature process = more formal review
3. Complexity of the work product
4. Legal on regulatory requirements
5. Need for audit trail
- Types of Review:
1. Informal Review
- “Pair review”
- Quickly find defects or quickly solve process
- Not usually documented for review
- No process and is quick
1. Walkthrough
- Author walkthroughs the document
- Meeting is led by the author
- Main purpose is learning and gaining understanding
1. Technical Reviewing
- Focuses on achieving consensus on a technical aspect
- Evaluating work
- Reviewers are experts in their field
- Review meeting is optimal
- Scribe is mandatory
- Define lofs
- Keyword: led by a moderator
1. Inspection
- Most formal type of review
- Purpose: detecting potential defects
- Scribe is mandatory
- Led by a trained moderator

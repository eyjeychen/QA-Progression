**Introduction to Test Analysis and Design**

**Test techniques**

- Each test techniques tackles a different situation
- Helps the tester with test analysis (what to test) and test design (how to test)
- Define test conditions, test data and identify coverage items
- Effective Testing
    - Find more faults
    - Focus attention on specific types of faults
    - Know you're testing the right thing
- Efficient Testing
    - Find faults with less effort
    - Avoid duplication
    - Systematic techniques are measurable

**Categories of Test Techniques**

1. Black-box Techniques
- Tests are derived from a specification of a system
- “behavior-based “ techniques meaning you only know how the system should behave
- Applicable to both functional and non-functional
- Concentrate on input and output without reference ot its internal structure
1. White-box Techniques
- Deriving test cases directly from the structure of the system
- “structure-based”
1. Experience-based Techniques
- Based on the stakeholder’s experience
- Depends heavily based on the tester’s skills

**Black-box Test Techniques**

- Characteristics of Black-box:
    - Test conditions, test cases, etc are derived from a test basis that may include software requirements, specifications, etc
    - EP, BVA, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing

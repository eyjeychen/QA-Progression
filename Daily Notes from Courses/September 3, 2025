Test Monitoring, Test Control and Test Completion 
- Test monitoring is to gather information & provide feedback and visibility about test activities 
- Purpose/Purposes of test Monitoring: 
give feedback to test team & manager 
provide project team visibility about test results 
check if exit criteria is also satisfied 
gather data for use 
prove that the plan is right 
- Test Control is needed to get things back on track. It involves a guiding corrective action that is taken
-Test Control Actions Examples: 
Re-prioritization of tests due to risks. 
Changing test schedule due to availability
Re-evaluation of items for entry & exit criteria 
scope adjustment for testing due to change requests
Adding new resources 
-Test completion collects data from completed test activities
Metrics Used in Testing
test metrics are gathered to 
show progress against the test plan 
current quality of the test object 
effectiveness of the test activities with respect to the objectives or an iteration
 Example of nutrics is Project Progress Metrics
Project Progress Metrics 
Task Completion: Measures progress of tasks
Resource Usage: utilization of resource to ensure good allocation 
Test effort: overall effort invested in testing 
Test Progress Metrics: 
test Case implementation progress 
test environment Preparation progress
Number of test cases Run/not Run 
Number of test cases passed/Failed 
Test execution time
 Product Quality Metrics 
Availability. 
Response Time 
Mean Time to failure
Defect Metrics 
Number and Priorities of Defects Found/Fixed 
Defect Density = defects per unit 
Defect Detection percentage 
Risk Metrics 
Residual Risk Level = assesses level of risk that remains after mitigation efforts 
Coverage Metrics. 
Requirements coverage = percentage of requirements covered by test cases 
Code coverage = extent of code exercised by the test cases
Cost Metrics 
Cost of Testing 
organizational cost of quality 
Metrics assist in monitoring progress, assess quality, managing risks & making informed decisions
 Purpose, Content and Audience for Test Reports 
purposes of test Reporting 
Notifying project stakeholders about test results 
Help stakeholders understand & analyze results of a test period 
Help stakeholders to make decisions about how to guide the project forward 
Assuring that the original test plan will lead us to achieve testing goals 
Types of Test Reports: 
Test progress reports 
A test report prepared during a test activity 
supports the ongoing control at the testing 
key components in a test progress report: 
test period = Time of report and activities 
test progress = Summanizes overall progress of testing activities. 
Impediments for testing and their workaround = obstacles & how to our them 
test metrics 
New & changed risks  within the testing period 
Testing planned for the next period
Test completion reports 
summarizes the testing efforts & outcomes 
issues when exit criteria are reached
Elements of a test completion report: 
Test summary 
Testing & Product Quality Evaluation 
Deviations from the test plan 
Testing impediments & workarounds 
Test Metrics Based on test progress reports 
unmitigated risks and defects not fixed
 Communicating Status of Testing 
Means of communication should align w/ the organization test strategy 
There are regulatory standards some organization follows 
To also consider team members location 
communication options include: 
verbal communication = audience interaction 
dashboards = visual representation (example: burn-down charts which illustrate how work is decreasing overtime 
electronic communication channels=real-time updates 
online documentation = comprehensive information 
formal test reports = structured information which are structured documents that provide a detailed overview
 Configuration Management 
correct version of the software module?
version of the software System 
purpose is to establish and maintain integrity of the component or system 
version control 
test documentation 
should be identified during TEST PLANNING 
usually automated during DEVOPS
Defect Management
Ensures that defects are tracked
Depends on the organization
Testers should minimize false-positives marked as defects
Typical Defect Reports Objectives:
Provide developers and others about any defect
Provide test managers a mean of tracking the quality of the work product
Provide ideas for development and test process improvement
Defect Report Outline:
UID
Title and short summary
Date of the defect report
Identification of the test object
Context of the defect
Description of the failure to enable recreation
Expected and actual results
Steps to reproduce
Scope or degree of impact
Urgency/priority to fix
State of the defect report

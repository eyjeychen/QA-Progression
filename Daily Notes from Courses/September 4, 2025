Tools Support for Testing:
Tools are classified in the syllabus according to the test activities that they support
Testing Tool Categories:
Management Tools
Static Testing Tools
Test design and implementation tools
Test execution & coverage tools
Non-functional testing tools
DevOps Tools 
Collaboration Tools
Tools supporting scalability and deployment standardization
Any other tool that assists in testing
1. Management Tools
Supports managing the test processes and increasing efficiency
Test management tools : test managers and leaders for reports
Requirements Management Tools: Help manage the requirements
Defect Management Tools: Defects are used heavily used by testers and developers
Configuration Management Tools: used by everyone
Continuous Integration Tools: usually used by developers
2. Static Testing Tools
Tools used in static testing
Normally used by developers as part of development and component testing
3. Test Design and Implementation Tools
Creation of maintainable work products
4. Test Execution and Coverage Tools
Test automation tools 
Usually called “test scripts”
Developers usually use coverage measurement tools
5. Non-functional Tools
Usually impossible to perform manually
6. DevOps Tools
Designed to help software development and delivery teams test their code more effectively
7. Collaboration Tools
File sharing, instant messaging, cloud storage, etc
Facilitates communication between team members
8. Tools supporting scalability and deployment standardization
Designed to address the challenges of testing large and complex systems that require efficient scaling
Benefits and Risks of Test Automation
Benefits of Using Tools to Support test execution:
Repetitive work is reduced
Greater consistency and repeatability
Objective assessment
Ease of access to information about tests or testing
Reduced test execution times
More time for testers
Risks:
Unrealistic expectations for the tools
Understanding effort for using the tool
Using a test tool when manual testing is more appropriate
Over-reliance on the tool
Dependency on the tool vendor
Risk of suspension of open-source/free tool project
The automation tool is not compatible with the development platform
Choosing an unsuitable tool that does not comply with the regulatory requirements

Why is Testing Necessary?
 From the user’s perspective:
It is everywhere
Software that has minor issues might cause huge problems and frustrations
Can cause:
Money loss
Waste of time and effort
Business reputation
Loss of life
No issue is small

From the project management perspective:
It is a form of quality control

Typical Objectives in Testing:
Evaluating work products such as user requirements, user stories , designs and code
Causing failures and finding defects
Ensuring required coverage of a test object
Reducing the risk level of inadequate software quality
Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled
Verifying that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements
Providing information to stake holders to allow them to make informed decisions
Building confidence in the quality of a test object
Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders
Test objectives  are usually straight forward 
Test objectives display a list of time and ask what is a test objectives and what is not

Validation vs Verification
Validation mentions the user more and asks if we are building the right product
Verification mentions the documents more and asks if are we building the product right

Errors, Defects and Failures
A person makes an error that creates a defect / bug in the software that can cause a failure in the system operation
Example:
Someone has a fever (failure, a symptom you can see) and goes to the Dr who decides something is wrong with the stomach (a defect) because the patient ate too much (error)
Failures can also be caused by environmental conditions

False-positive vs False-negative
False-positive
We did something wrong which we thought we found a defect but it was a wrong finding
Probably duet to:
Errors in the test execution
Defects in the test data
Test environments
Other reasons
False-negative
We did something wrong but we cannot find the defect

Root Cause Analysis 
Helps in preventive measures for the software in the near future

Root Cause, Error, Defect, Failure
Root causes leads to human error which then leads to the defect thus the failure
Example:
The designer is tired (root cause)
Designer documents wrong for disabled users (error)
The programmers are in a severe time pressure (root cause)
So they did not include exception handling for calculations (error)

Dynamic and Static Testing
Dynamic testing is testing that occurs once the system is already there, so expect that there will be defects
Static testing takes place early in the software life cycle
Includes techniques such as reviewing documents and prevents defects from being introduced into the code
